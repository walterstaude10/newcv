      Hello, my name is Walter St-Aude and I am a software and app developer.

      and elements including HTML 5, CSS (not limited to Bootstrap, Foundation,
      Materialize, and Semantic UI), NodeJS, Atom, Visual Studio, MongoDB, to gain
      employment with a company looking to maximinze and grow my
      abilities as a developer.
